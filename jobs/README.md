# Scholens Jobs

The Jobs service runs long-lived Scholens workflows outside the API process.
Celery workers consume RabbitMQ queues, use Redis for task results and resumable
parser state, and return signed results to the Server webhook API.

## PDF ingestion

The PDF worker follows one explicit, local-first pipeline:

1. Download the original PDF from private S3 storage.
2. Analyze the PDF locally with PyMuPDF: per-page text statistics, preview,
   and deterministic page offsets (milliseconds per page).
3. Classify the document:
   - **Scanned PDF** (empty or near-empty text layer, or repeated boilerplate
     such as per-page watermarks) is submitted to MinerU, the only OCR-capable
     parser, and shares one 600-second deadline across polling and archive
     download.
   - **Digital PDF** (≥80% of uploads: arXiv, journal, most conference PDFs)
     stays local:
     a. `pymupdf4llm` extracts page-chunked Markdown with exact per-page
        offsets (primary engine);
     b. on failure, `markitdown` is tried as a second engine and is persisted
        as `text_only` because its output has no page boundaries (offsets are
        approximated from the local page analysis);
     c. if both local engines fail, MinerU rescues the document (OCR can
        recover misclassified or malformed PDFs);
     d. if the MinerU rescue fails or times out, the deterministic per-page
        text from step 2 is persisted as `text_only` with exact offsets.
4. Store Markdown and preview; only the MinerU path produces an audit archive
   (`mineru-result.zip`).
5. Extract metadata with DeepSeek unless the caller supplied authoritative
   metadata, as Zotero imports do.
6. Send the result and token usage to Server through an HMAC-signed webhook.

The worker also sends a signed stage projection and heartbeat at bounded
intervals. Public progress is limited to `queued`, `parsing`, `extracting`,
`indexing`, and `finalizing`; provider-specific payloads never become client
state. The task checks Server-owned cancellation before and after expensive
boundaries. Revocation uses `terminate=False`: pending work can be skipped, and
running work exits cooperatively without killing a worker process. Soft and hard
task limits bound the complete workflow so a lost provider response cannot
leave a Library row processing forever.

Local engines (`pymupdf4llm`, `markitdown`) are CPU-only, run in-process with
a bounded time budget per engine, and never send document content off-host.
MinerU is used only for scanned PDFs and as a rescue for digital PDFs whose
local extraction failed; its results are persisted as `full` quality. A
`text_only` result (local fallback or rescue timeout) is persisted so the
client can warn that layout-dependent content may be incomplete.

MinerU task IDs are checkpointed in Redis under the job ID. Four consecutive
network failures switch polling or downloading to a slower bounded backoff;
they do not end the task before its deadline. A redelivered Celery task resumes
the same provider task instead of submitting another one. The checkpoint is
cleared after Server acknowledges the result.

## AI reading reflow

After Server accepts a successful PDF callback, it dispatches a separate
`generate_document_reflow` task to the `reflow` queue. The worker downloads the
already-persisted canonical Markdown; it does not parse the PDF again and does
not alter the parser order above. Source units preserve fenced code and display
math, and requests are bounded to 20,000 source characters.

The provider-neutral `reflow` profile classifies layout roles only. Every AI
response must contain each supplied source index exactly once and in ascending
order. A malformed response or provider failure falls back for that chunk to a
deterministic local classification and records `ai_chunk_fallback:<index>`.
Stable block IDs, exact source Markdown, page projections, source fingerprint,
prompt revision, profile revision, and warnings return through the signed
generic job callback. Server is the persistence authority.

Parser-specific tests mirror this structure under `tests/pdf/`.

## Configuration

The repository-level [`.env.example`](../.env.example) is the only environment
variable catalog. Copy the values needed by Jobs into `jobs/.env`; never commit
that file.

Production requires:

- RabbitMQ through `CELERY_BROKER_URL`
- Redis through `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` and optionally `PDF_PARSE_REDIS_URL`
- S3 credentials and bucket names
- `MINERU_API_TOKEN`
- the `SCHOLENS_AI_*` profile variables and the selected provider credential
- `JOBS_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`

Development may omit `MINERU_API_TOKEN`; PDF ingestion then runs explicitly in
local `text_only` mode. Production fails fast when the token or parser Redis
configuration is absent.

## Local commands

Install and verify:

```bash
uv sync
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run mypy src/pdf src/schemas.py src/tasks.py
uv run pytest -q
```

Start the local stack:

```bash
uv run --frozen --no-sync start
```

This optional profile starts RabbitMQ on `127.0.0.1:55672`, Redis on
`127.0.0.1:56379`, the worker, one Beat scheduler, and the Jobs API on
`127.0.0.1:7302`. It does not install dependencies or apply database
migrations. Run it only when exercising uploads, parsing, background work, or
Zotero synchronization. Flower is separately available on
`127.0.0.1:7307` with `./scripts/start_flower.sh`.

For object storage, Jobs uses the same isolated remote dev S3 bucket as Server,
with matching values in the two ignored `.env` files. Scholens does not start
MinIO. Never use the production bucket or production workload credentials in
the local Jobs profile.

Run an opt-in real MinerU check with a local PDF:

```bash
uv run python scripts/smoke_mineru.py "/absolute/path/to/test-paper.pdf"
```

The smoke test uses real provider quota and is intentionally excluded from CI.
It prints the `submit`, `upload`, `poll`, `download`, and `archive` stages
independently, plus safe IDs, timings, output size, and classified diagnostics.
It never prints credentials or the signed upload URL.
