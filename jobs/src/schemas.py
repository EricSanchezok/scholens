            Generate a concise summary of the research paper (< 200 words) that captures the essential contribution for readers with basic domain knowledge. Break each of the sections up for clarity. Separate sections with blank lines to ensure proper paragraph breaks in markdown. Do not use literal `\n` characters for line breaks. Do not use separate headings for each section.

            ## Structure:
            Write 1-2 sentences on each section covering:
            1. **Background**: What gap or question does this address?
            2. **Methodology**: What methods, datasets, or techniques were used?
            3. **Findings**: What were the main results? What are the implications? Include specific metrics when available.

            ## Citation Requirements:
            - Use inline citations [^1], [^2] to support factual claims, especially numerical results. The citation index should match the corresponding entry in the `summary_citations` field.
            - Use sequential numbering starting from [^1]

            ## Quality Standards:
            - Write in clear, accessible language while maintaining technical accuracy
            - Focus on the paper's primary contribution—omit secondary findings
            - Present findings objectively, including limitations when relevant
            - If constrained for length, prioritize key results and implications

            The goal is a focused, readable paragraph that gives someone a quick understanding of what the paper accomplishes.

Extract 3-5 standout highlights that capture the most compelling and unique aspects of this research paper. Focus on what makes this paper distinctive rather than summarizing standard content.

Requirements for Highlights:
- Each highlight should be a direct, exact quote from the paper
- Each highlight must be accompanied by a brief annotation (1-2 sentences) explaining its significance or relevance to the paper's contributions

Selection Criteria:
Prioritize highlights that are:
- Novel or surprising: Unexpected findings, counterintuitive results, or breakthrough discoveries
- Methodologically innovative: New techniques, creative experimental designs, or unique approaches
- High-impact insights: Findings that could change how the field thinks about a problem
- Quantitatively significant: Impressive performance gains, large effect sizes, or notable statistical findings
- Practically valuable: Real-world applications, actionable implications, or scalable solutions

Content Sources:
- Key results from tables/figures: Extract specific metrics, comparisons, or visual insights
- Critical methodology details: Novel algorithms, experimental setups, or analytical approaches
- Standout conclusions: Bold claims, important limitations, or paradigm-shifting implications
- Notable observations: Interesting patterns, unexpected behaviors, or important caveats

Quality Guidelines:
- Selectivity: Choose only the most essential "must-read" elements—what would experts in the field find most noteworthy?
- Specificity: Prefer concrete findings over general statements
- Diversity: Ensure highlights span different aspects (methods, results, implications) and types, without referencing the abstract
- Context: Each annotation should explain *why* this highlight matters to the broader research landscape

What to Avoid:
- Generic background information or literature review content
- Standard methodology descriptions unless truly innovative
- Routine experimental procedures or common practices
- Abstract-level summaries that don't reveal paper specifics
- Redundant highlights that convey similar information
- Snippets that are pulled directly from the abstract or summary

Think: "If I could only share 3-5 insights from this paper with a colleague, what would make them most excited to read the full work?"

A concise, well-structured summary of the paper in markdown format. Include:
1. Key findings and contributions
2. Research methodology
3. Results and implications
4. Potential applications or impact

Format guidelines:
- Optional opening title (under 10 words)
- First paragraph: 2-4 sentence overview of the paper
- Use clear headings, bullet points, and tables for organization
- Include relevant data points and metrics when available
- Use plain language while preserving technical accuracy
- Include inline citations to support claims that refer to the paper's content. This is especially important for claims about the findings, methodology, and results.

Citation guidelines:
- Use [^1], [^2], [^6, ^7] etc. for citations in the summary
- Always increase the index of the citation sequentially, starting from 1
- You will separately provide a list of citations in the `summary_citations` field with the raw text and index

The summary should be accessible to readers with basic domain knowledge while maintaining scientific integrity.
