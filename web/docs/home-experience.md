# Home Experience

Home is the first production slice of the replacement frontend. Its canonical
design is the Figma page `20 — Home`, including the default workspace, collapsed
sidebar, context picker, recent content, and conversation states. Figma owns
visual hierarchy and acceptance; this document records runtime ownership and
the deliberately deferred boundaries.

## Entry and ownership

- `/` requires an authenticated session. Anonymous visitors are sent to
  `/login` with a safe return target.
- The selected conversation is shareable navigation state and therefore lives
  in `?conversation=<uuid>`. A refresh restores that conversation.
- Conversations, papers, projects, and message history are server state owned
  by TanStack Query. Composer input uses React Hook Form and Zod; its form state
  is owned by `HomeWorkspace` so responsive composition changes never discard
  an unsent draft. Sidebar, picker, and in-progress stream state remain local.
- Desktop and mobile share one navigation model, actor state, conversation
  state, and `AppShell` boundary, but use device-appropriate compositions. The
  desktop sidebar is 240 px when expanded and 72 px when collapsed. Phones use
  a persistent bottom bar for Ask, Library, and Projects. Their full-width
  navigation hub is reserved for conversation search, pinned/recent history,
  and the account trigger anchored above the bottom safe area; it does not
  repeat the primary destinations or render the desktop Sidebar inside a
  narrow drawer. The hub closes with a directional collapse control rather
  than a dismiss-style X.
- Collapsing the desktop sidebar changes only its horizontal geometry. The top
  control, navigation rows, and account trigger retain their vertical anchors.
- Deferred destinations retain their product names in the visible navigation;
  availability is disclosed through the disabled control and its tooltip, not
  implementation-plan copy.

## Data and streaming

Home consumes only the public conversation, project, library-paper, and actor
contracts. It does not import from `client/` and does not define duplicate wire
DTOs.

Conversation creation and continuation use one standard SSE decoder. The
stream accepts `start`, the stable-ID `assistant_item_start → delta → complete`
lifecycle, `activity`, `references`, `complete`, and `error`. A provisional
assistant item is rendered immediately, then atomically classified as
`progress` or `final` by its completion event; the client never infers phase
from prose and never duplicates the text while moving it. Progress and activity
share one sequence and become an ordered worklog. The final answer remains
outside that trace and is always visible.

`activity` is an ID-addressed, sanitized tool lifecycle record without a raw
tool name. Adjacent tool entries are rendered as one category-count batch;
progress text separates batches. Model reasoning, provider heartbeats, raw tool
names, arguments, and return payloads are not product UI. Only final items may
publish references. `complete` and `error` are terminal. The user may abort an
active stream; the Web app never automatically retries turn or response
creation. Once
a turn is accepted into the optimistic transcript, the Composer clears
immediately and its send action becomes the standard stop-square action for
the lifetime of that stream. A failure before optimistic acceptance preserves
the draft; a later stream failure preserves the submitted user message in the
transcript instead of restoring duplicate text to the Composer.
Capacity dependency outages are returned as `unavailable`, not as a user quota
exhaustion. The interface preserves the failed user message, explains that it
was saved, and retains the public diagnostic ID without exposing provider or
Redis details.
After completion, only the active conversation, its turns, and the conversation
list are invalidated. A turn owns the submitted prompt and its generated
response variants. Only the latest turn may expose retry and variant selection;
once a newer turn is submitted, prior alternatives and their controls are
removed from the product history.
Every completed answer exposes a copy action for the selected final response.
Retry creates a new response variant under the same latest turn, selects it
after completion, and never duplicates the user prompt. Version navigation is
shown only while that turn remains latest. Exactly three persisted follow-up
suggestions belong to the selected completed response; selecting one only
fills and focuses the Composer so the user can edit it before sending.
Suggestion generation is deliberately secondary: pending work uses a quiet
three-row placeholder and a failed suggestion job leaves the completed answer
usable with one muted status line. Neither state retries automatically or
changes the response lifecycle.
Grounded answers expose one source-count pill in the same action row. Selecting
that pill opens the single canonical source panel: a bottom sheet on phones and
a centered dialog on desktop. Inline citation markers open that same panel and
highlight the corresponding source instead of introducing a second source
list. Document and external sources share the same evidence rows; only external
sources navigate away, and they open in a new tab.
The Server replaces the default Sidebar title once after the first successful
assistant reply. Follow-up turns do not regenerate it, and user renames are
never overwritten by title generation.

## State coverage

| Surface      | Deterministic coverage                                                                |

The canonical ordered-harness matrix is Figma node `893:3415`, with Desktop
Light/Dark and Mobile Light/Dark groups. The superseded per-tool activity
checklist is archived under `99 — Archive / Interaction States`.

The final-answer action and evidence contract is the authoritative Figma matrix
[`906:2628`](https://www.figma.com/design/2T5BuTPMIrM2jsVhgIVYIX/Scholens-%E2%80%94-Product-Design?node-id=906-2628),
`Matrix / Final answer actions and sources v2`:

| Figma `20 — Home / Final answer actions and sources` | Storybook acceptance state                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Latest answer actions                                | `Conversation View / Latest Answer Actions`          |

The matrix covers mobile Light/Dark final actions, the mobile source bottom
sheet, the desktop action row and centered source dialog, an inline selected
citation, three editable follow-up suggestions, and pointer/touch versus
keyboard focus acceptance. Storybook keeps locale, appearance, and 320/390/430
px viewport controls available for the same executable states. The superseded
phone reading surface at node `898:2628` is archived under
`99 — Archive / Interaction States`; it is historical reference, not a current
implementation contract.

The answer-action row uses one Iconoir source with optical sizing rather than
equal glyph sizes: Copy renders at 20 px and Refresh at 16 px so their visible
bounds match. Version navigation, Copy, and Refresh form one gapless tool group
with transparent resting surfaces; hover, active, and keyboard focus reveal
the individual hit target without dividing the row into persistent blocks.
Mobile hit targets remain 44 px and desktop hit targets are 32 px. Disabled
arrows retain normal opacity and use the muted semantic color. Follow-up
suggestions have no visible heading or repeated icon: phones use 44 px pills,
while desktop uses full-width rows separated by the subtle border token.

Reader consumes the same message contract instead of defining a second
conversation renderer. Its authoritative Figma matrix is
[`50 — Reader / Matrix / Reader conversation contract v2`](https://www.figma.com/design/2T5BuTPMIrM2jsVhgIVYIX/Scholens-%E2%80%94-Product-Design?node-id=910-2):
Reader contributes only the current paper, passage, and selection as default
scope; the ordered worklog, final-answer actions, suggestions, citations, and
source panel remain the Home semantics described above. The former Reader
process-card frames are archived under `99 — Archive / Interaction States` and
are not implementation references.

The mobile Dock acceptance inventory extends that mapping:

| Figma `20 — Home / Mobile` target | Storybook acceptance state                          |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Empty + Dock / Ask selected       | `Workspace / Mobile Empty`                          |
| Recent research launcher          | `Workspace / Mobile`                                |
| Launcher loading                  | `Dashboard / Mobile Recents Loading`                |
| Launcher error                    | `Dashboard / Mobile Recents Error`                  |
| Launcher removed after submit     | `Workspace / Mobile Recents Disappear After Submit` |
| Conversation + Dock               | `Workspace / Mobile Conversation`                   |
| Keyboard Open                     | `Workspace / Mobile Keyboard Open`                  |

| Multiline input                   | `Research Composer / Multiline Input`               |
| Mobile reasoning menu             | `Workspace / Mobile Reasoning Menu Open`            |
| Desktop reasoning menu            | `Research Composer / Desktop Reasoning Menu Open`   |
| Streaming / Stop                  | `Research Composer / Streaming Stop`                |
| 430 px Dark English               | `Research Composer / Dark English Large`            |

The mobile acceptance set is synchronized to the active `20 — Home` Figma
page. Its primary navigation state uses the shared action surface and inverse
icon roles for the current destination, while inactive destinations retain the
muted semantic role. Each future destination must supply its own
`aria-current="page"` state when its vertical slice becomes available; Home
does not create placeholder routes merely to demonstrate those states.
The selected-state specimens are the node-specific
[Ask](https://www.figma.com/design/2T5BuTPMIrM2jsVhgIVYIX/Scholens-%E2%80%94-Product-Design?node-id=882-3416),
[Library](https://www.figma.com/design/2T5BuTPMIrM2jsVhgIVYIX/Scholens-%E2%80%94-Product-Design?node-id=882-3437),
and
[Projects](https://www.figma.com/design/2T5BuTPMIrM2jsVhgIVYIX/Scholens-%E2%80%94-Product-Design?node-id=882-3458)
frames. Library and Projects document the future selected visual state only;
their runtime destinations remain deliberately unavailable in the Home slice.

The former heavy process card and per-tool checklist are archived in Figma and
are not supported Web states. `Conversation View / Narrow Long Subject` and
`Conversation View / Simplified Chinese Dark` supplement the Figma mapping with
runtime overflow, locale, and appearance coverage. Optimistic and persisted
turns are reconciled by `turn_id`; the isolated deduplication state guards
against showing the same submitted prompt twice while a stream is active.

Each generated response owns one `ConversationWorklog` before its final answer.
During a run it opens by default; a final item collapses it unless the user has
manually chosen a state. Persisted history starts collapsed. Expanded rows
interleave concise progress with grouped tool batches, show at most two safe
subject examples per batch, and never create nested tool disclosures. The
summary is the only polite live-region announcement, so screen readers do not
receive every tool update. The same semantic component is used on desktop and
mobile, with compact responsive spacing and no inner scrolling surface.

On phones, the shell uses a 64 px content bar plus platform safe-area insets.
The bar owns navigation, a compact text-only reasoning-strength selector, and
the new-chat action. Its trigger and narrow menu expose only the Standard and
Deep labels; descriptions remain a desktop Composer affordance. Model
selection is not part of the Scholens product surface. Conversation content uses a stable
16 px body with 28 px line height, 22/19/17 px heading steps, and 20 px
horizontal gutters at the primary phone widths (16 px at 320 px). Browser text
adjustment is fixed at 100%, preventing Android Chrome from inflating a long
answer independently of the rest of the shell. CJK falls back to the platform
system family; emphasis uses weight rather than another font face. Long words
and links wrap inside the reading measure, while only code blocks and tables
receive their own horizontal scrolling surface.

The mobile worklog keeps the same typed ordered entries as desktop, but its
expanded state uses a quiet vertical rail and one semantic marker per progress
phase or grouped tool batch. It does not restore individual tool cards or
per-call checkmarks. References are summarized as one touch-sized source pill;
the source rows appear only when that disclosure is opened. When the reader
moves away from the bottom of an overflowing conversation, a 48 px
`Jump to latest` action appears immediately above the Dock and disappears on
return. These are presentation rules only: desktop density, Agent events, and
persisted conversation data remain unchanged. A single
`MobileBottomDock` owns the Composer, primary navigation, horizontal safe-area
gutters, bottom safe area, and stacking layer. The Composer and navigation are
separated by 4 px inside the Dock rather than behaving as independent floating
surfaces; a non-layout 20 px fade softens the transition from scrolling content.
Only one real Composer is mounted at a time. On desktop it rests as a rounded
single-line bar and expands to a rounded panel for multiline input or selected
sources. On phones it stays one compact row above primary navigation: the
Iconoir AtSign context trigger anchors the left, the input owns the flexible
middle slot, and the circular submit or stop action anchors the right. The
context trigger's accessible name and native title carry the current library,
project, paper, mixed-item, or empty-selection scope. Standard and Deep open
one text-only radio menu from the phone header or desktop Composer instead of a
segmented toggle. The phone menu is a compact two-label list; the desktop menu
retains one supporting description per mode. Decorative mode icons do not
repeat the labels. The separate selected-source chip remains desktop-only.
The canonical responsive Composer contract is Figma node
[`923:2628`](https://www.figma.com/design/2T5BuTPMIrM2jsVhgIVYIX/Scholens-%E2%80%94-Product-Design?node-id=923-2628),
`Matrix / Composer v2`. It supersedes earlier isolated Composer compositions;
whole-screen frames remain contextual references for the surrounding shell.
Every scope, send, stop, and navigation target remains at least 48 px.
The current bottom-navigation destination is represented by both
`aria-current="page"` and a filled circular icon surface, with a stronger label.
This state is not color-only: shape, weight, and semantics remain distinguishable
in monochrome, Dark appearance, and high-contrast environments.

When the Composer receives focus, the shell freezes the pre-focus viewport
height and compares it with `visualViewport.height` to distinguish a soft
keyboard from a hardware keyboard. It deliberately ignores
`visualViewport.offsetTop`: Android Chrome changes that value while panning a
focused page, which must not remount the navigation. The offset is still
applied as a shell translation while the keyboard is open, compensating for
Chrome's visual-viewport pan so the Dock remains immediately above the
keyboard. A soft keyboard hides the three-item navigation, removes the Dock's
bottom safe-area padding, and constrains the shell to the visible viewport.
Navigation returns only after the visible height recovers or focus leaves the
Composer, without changing the message scroll position. Browsers without
`visualViewport` fall back to hiding navigation while the mobile Composer is
focused.
Markdown is rendered as semantic headings, lists, links, code, and
horizontally scrollable tables; raw HTML is not accepted. The same messages,
stream reducer, context state, and submission logic are used by desktop and
mobile.

The mobile visual baseline is represented by `Home / Workspace / Mobile Empty`,
`Mobile Composer Expanded`, `Mobile Conversation`, `Mobile Conversation Large`,
`Mobile Reasoning Menu Open`, `Mobile Navigation Open`, and `Mobile Processing`, plus
`Conversation View / Mobile Research Answer` in Light and Dark. The acceptance
set covers 390 x 844 and 430 x 932; 320 x 568 is an overflow and
minimum-usability check rather than the primary aesthetic target.

Figma `20 — Home` also records the phone-specific recent-content contract as
`Home / Mobile / Recents populated` (`889:3416`), `Recents loading`
(`889:3456`), `Recents error` (`889:3490`), and `Recents hidden after submit`
(`889:3521`). These frames intentionally use a single compact launcher list
instead of shrinking the desktop paper and project cards.

When both recent-paper and recent-project queries settle empty, Home uses a
focused first-run composition instead of preserving empty card silhouettes.
On phones, its composer sits at the bottom of the usable canvas immediately
above primary navigation; the research prompt remains in the available reading
area rather than pulling the input toward screen center. On desktop, the 760 px
composer retains the centered Figma composition. Its textarea delegates focus
presentation to the rounded composer boundary. Pointer and touch focus leave
that boundary visually stable; keyboard navigation alone receives the shared
semantic focus indicator, so a native rectangular outline never splits the
composition.
The account trigger sits against the sidebar's bottom safe-area inset without a
redundant disclosure arrow. Its menu aligns to the expanded sidebar content
edge and opens to the right of the collapsed rail.
On desktop, when only one collection has data, only that section is rendered
and centered; loading and recoverable errors remain visible per collection.
The populated desktop state continues to follow the canonical two-paper and
three-project layout. On phones, papers and projects are merged by recent
activity into at most three compact scope launchers above the Dock. Selecting
one sets the research scope; it does not submit a question. Loading uses the
same short-row footprint, and the entire launcher leaves the composition as
soon as the first message creates a conversation.

The visual acceptance pass also includes a 2560 px wide viewport so the
first-run composition remains intentional on large desktop displays.

Storybook is the isolated state catalog. Playwright covers authenticated route
composition, the context interaction, accessibility, locale selection, and
narrow-screen containment. The real local Server remains the final integration
check.

## Deferred by design

Library, Projects, Reader, Translation, and Settings routes remain disabled
navigation destinations until their own vertical slices begin. Home does not
introduce abstractions for those pages, edit conversation metadata, or add a
legacy-client compatibility layer. Any newly discovered backend gap must block
a current Home behavior before the contract is expanded.
