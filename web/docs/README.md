# Scholens Web Engineering Handbook

This directory is the operating contract for the replacement frontend. Its
purpose is to keep the codebase easy to change as product routes are added.

## Source-of-truth order

When two sources disagree, use this order:

1. Executable contracts: TypeScript, generated schemas, tests, and CI.
2. Architecture decisions in `docs/decisions/`.
3. The engineering guides in this directory.
4. Figma annotations and product notes.

Figma remains the source for layout intent, visual hierarchy, interaction
states, and design acceptance. The repository is the source for token values,
runtime behavior, accessibility, data contracts, and component APIs.

## Maintenance rule

Documentation changes ship with the code that invalidates them. Do not create
parallel guides in feature folders. Feature-local README files may explain
domain behavior, but architecture, component, token, API, and testing rules
remain centralized here.
