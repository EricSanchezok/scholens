# Scholens evaluations

This directory contains the maintained end-to-end Data Table evaluation and
the historical ResearchQA methodology paper.

## Data Table extraction

`run_data_table_eval.py` seeds the bundled PDFs into a local Scholens stack,
submits real Data Table jobs, and grades primitive and derived values.

Prerequisites:

- Server, Jobs worker, broker, PostgreSQL, and S3 are running.
- `EVAL_USER_ID` is the numeric ID of an existing sanchezcloud-identity user.
- `EVAL_BEARER_TOKEN` is a valid sanchezcloud-identity bearer token for that same user.
- The user has enough Token Credits for the requested runs.

```bash
cd server
uv run python -m evals.run_data_table_eval --runs 1
```

Use `--seed-only`, `--skip-seed`, or `--grade-only` for narrower workflows.
Results are written to `evals/results/eval_data_table.json`.

## ResearchQA archive

The ResearchQA benchmark predates Scholens's provider-neutral AI runtime and its
current sanchezcloud-identity/database contracts. Its paper remains in
[`paper.md`](paper.md), and the published dataset is available at
[`khoj-ai/ResearchQA`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/khoj-ai/ResearchQA).
The exact historical harness used for the published results is preserved in
the repository commit linked by the paper; it is intentionally not carried as
unrunnable production code in the current tree.
