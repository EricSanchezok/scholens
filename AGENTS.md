# Scholens agent development guide

This file is the mandatory entry point for agents modifying this repository.
It defines navigation and guardrails; detailed rules stay in their canonical
documents so they do not drift across multiple copies.

## Read before changing code

Always read the documents relevant to the task before editing:

| Area                                            | Required reading                                                                           |

For new `web/` product work, also complete
[`web/docs/new-feature-checklist.md`](./web/docs/new-feature-checklist.md).
Every addition, modification, or deletion of a Web page, module, component,
token, theme, or Storybook state must follow
[`web/docs/frontend-governance.md`](./web/docs/frontend-governance.md).

## Repository boundaries

- `web/` is the replacement frontend and the canonical target for new product
  development.
- `client/` is the legacy comparison frontend. Do not import from it, share
  runtime code with it, or add new product features to it unless the user
  explicitly requests legacy maintenance.
- `server/` owns the FastAPI application and synchronous product APIs.
- `jobs/` owns asynchronous workers and their job-facing API.
- Product code must respect the schema and service ownership documented in
  `docs/architecture/data-ownership.md`.
- Do not create compatibility layers between the old and new frontends. Evolve
  the public API contract deliberately instead.
- Until the product is explicitly declared released, breaking product API and
  `scholens` schema changes are reset-first: converge on one contract and
  remove superseded routes, DTOs, columns, workflows, and tests in the same
  change. Do not add dual read/write paths, legacy mappings, compatibility
  flags, or backfills whose only purpose is preserving disposable pre-release
  product data. Reset only the `scholens` schema and rebuild it explicitly;
  `auth` data remains independently owned and must never be dropped.
- Local development owns the `7300-7399` host-port block: Web `7300`, Server
  `7301`, Jobs `7302`, legacy client `7303`, Storybook `7306`, and Flower
  `7307`. Scholens local infrastructure uses PostgreSQL `55432`, RabbitMQ
  `55672`, and Redis `56379`, all on `127.0.0.1`. Ports `59000/59001` remain
  reserved for projects that explicitly choose local MinIO; Scholens does not
  start or consume MinIO by default.
- Local entrypoints must use fixed ports, bind to loopback, and fail on a
  conflict. Never add port auto-increment, install dependencies, or apply
  migrations as a side effect of a daily startup command.
- `server` local startup must retain its guard against any database other than
  `127.0.0.1:55432/sanchezcloud`. RDS and production object storage are outside
  local-development scope. Scholens local development uses its isolated remote
  dev S3 bucket and product-specific Aliyun DirectMail settings; neither may
  reuse production resources.
- Remote model and search providers are opt-in for the feature being tested.
  Keep their credentials in ignored service-local environment files.

## Replacement frontend rules

The canonical rules live in [`web/docs`](./web/docs/README.md). In particular:

- routes compose features; they do not contain large business implementations;
- product code is organized as vertical feature slices when implementation
  actually begins;
- generic controls belong in `components/ui`, shared asynchronous patterns in
  `components/feedback`, and product components inside their feature;
- components use semantic design tokens and the Iconoir wrapper—no raw brand
  colors or second icon system;
- server state uses TanStack Query, shareable navigation state uses the URL,
  forms use React Hook Form and Zod, and local interaction state stays local;
- backend wire types are generated from the committed public OpenAPI snapshot;
  do not handwrite duplicate DTOs;
- every reusable component needs isolated Storybook coverage, interaction
  states, keyboard behavior, narrow-content coverage, and Light/Dark review.
- Tailwind aliases are generated from the design-system adapter. Do not add
  manual `@theme` mappings, page-local raw colors, primitive palette variables,
  `dark:` appearance patches, or repeated typography/elevation recipes.
- interface copy follows `web/docs/internationalization.md`; UI locale and
  Reader content translation are separate product concepts.
- Do not invent a temporary page, substitute feature, compatibility facade, or
  fake-data workflow merely because a downstream feature is unfinished. Keep
  the current slice honest with an explicit localized unavailable state, then
  connect the real dependency when its own vertical slice is implemented.

Do not mechanically recreate Figma layers or absolute coordinates. Figma owns
layout intent, visual hierarchy, interaction states, and acceptance; code owns
responsive behavior, accessibility, runtime contracts, and component APIs.

## Documentation responsibilities

Keep each fact in one canonical place instead of copying it across guides:

- `AGENTS.md` contains mandatory guardrails and navigation for agents.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` contains the human development, branch, commit, and PR
  workflow.
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` contains environment setup, fixed ports, and executable
  local commands.
- product, architecture, service, and feature documents describe the current
  behavior of the repository.
- package READMEs describe that package's public contract, consumers,
  dependency direction, and limitations.
- ADRs under `docs/decisions/` record why a consequential choice was made,
  including alternatives and consequences; they do not replace current-state
  documentation.
- PRs record the scope and actual verification for ordinary changes.
- postmortems are reserved for serious incidents or repeated regressions.

When behavior changes, update the canonical current-state document in the same
commit. Add or amend an ADR only when the reasoning or architectural boundary
changes.

## Generated artifacts

Do not edit generated files directly. Change their source and regenerate them.

- Design tokens: edit `web/src/design-system/tokens/` and semantic utility names
  in `web/src/design-system/adapters/`, then run `pnpm tokens:build` from
  `web/`.
- Frontend API types: update the FastAPI contract and public snapshot, then run
  `pnpm api:generate` from `web/`.
- Commit source and generated outputs together.

## Verification

Run checks proportional to the change through the side-effect-free root runner:

```bash
./scripts/run-gates.sh <server|jobs|shared-packages|web|client|deployment|docs|all>
```

The runner verifies an already provisioned checkout. It never installs
dependencies, starts services, or applies migrations. CI invokes these same
lanes and protects `main` through the aggregate `all checks passed` result.

The full replacement-frontend lane expands to:

```bash
cd web
pnpm tokens:check
pnpm api:check
pnpm i18n:check
pnpm architecture:check
pnpm design:check
pnpm docs:check
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:storybook
pnpm build-storybook
pnpm build
pnpm test:e2e
```

Use the targeted backend tests and Ruff checks described in `server/README.md`
when backend files change. A generated or documentation-only change may use a
smaller relevant subset, but the final handoff must state exactly what ran.

## Change hygiene

- Preserve unrelated user or agent changes in a dirty worktree.
- Never combine unrelated work in one commit.
- After a completed change is verified, commit it on the current branch and
  push that branch to its configured remote so finished work is not left only
  in the local worktree. Skip either step only when the user explicitly asks.
- For multi-step implementation, create a verified commit at each coherent
  recovery point when commits are within the requested workflow.
- Before staging, inspect the exact changed files; do not stage another agent's
  work merely because it is present.
- Architecture changes require an ADR under `docs/decisions/` or the
  appropriate service-level architecture documentation.
- Every code, configuration, or workflow change requires an explicit
  documentation-impact check. Documentation must change in the same commit as
  the behavior that invalidates it; if no documentation changes are needed,
  state that in the handoff.
- Keep upstream copyright, license, provenance, migration, and evaluation
  references unless their removal has been explicitly validated.
