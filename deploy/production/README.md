# Scholens production deployment

This package deploys Scholens to the existing SanchezCloud EC2/RDS environment. It uses the
same PostgreSQL database and `auth` schema as Scholight, while all Scholens-owned tables live in
an isolated `scholens` schema. `sanchezcloud-identity` remains an in-process SDK; there is no separate auth
HTTP service to operate.

The release contains three immutable ECR images (API, client, jobs), RabbitMQ and Redis on an
internal Docker network, and API/worker/beat processes. Only the existing Caddy gateway can reach
the Scholens client and API over the external `sanchezcloud-edge` Docker network.

## Current frontend release boundary

`web/` is the canonical source for new product development, but it has **not**
been cut over to this production package. The current Release workflow and
deployment contract still build `client/Dockerfile`, publish it to
`ECR_CLIENT_REPOSITORY`, and activate it through `SCHOLENS_CLIENT_IMAGE` in
Compose. In this document, **client** therefore means the legacy `client/`
application, not canonical `web/`.

Merging canonical Web product work into `main` establishes the reviewed source
baseline only. It does not make canonical `web/` production-ready, authorize
running the manual Release workflow, or constitute a production deployment. No
image, tag, or release is created by a source merge.

Canonical Web cutover requires a separate reviewed change that updates its
Docker image, public build configuration, edge routing, health and smoke checks,
Compose contract, source-map upload, CI image validation, activation, and
rollback path together. Until that change lands and is verified, production
continues to serve the legacy client.

The canonical Web build defaults Settings to
`https://myaccount.sanchezcloud.net`. For the future canonical Web cutover,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCOUNT_CENTER_URL` is an optional build-time public value that
overrides the Account Center host for an explicitly different environment;
when used, it must be injected while the Web image is built and cannot be
supplied through `/etc/scholens/runtime.env` after the bundle exists. The
current legacy-client production boundary is unchanged.

## Database boundary

- Use the shared `sanchezcloud` database. Cross-database foreign keys are not possible.
- `sanchezcloud-identity` alone owns `auth.*`; Scholens only references `auth.users(id)`.
- Scholens alone owns `scholens.*`; models and migrations qualify this schema explicitly.
- Use a dedicated `scholens_app` login for the API. It receives DML only.
- Use `auth_migrator` only for `auth.*` and `scholens_migrator` only for
  `scholens.*`. Neither role receives database-level `CREATE`.

Run the bootstrap as the RDS database owner before the first migration and once again after it:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_ADMIN_URL" \
  -v app_role=scholens_app \
  -v auth_migrator_role=auth_migrator \
  -v product_migrator_role=scholens_migrator \
  -f deploy/production/bootstrap-db.sql
```

Run this bootstrap before sanchezcloud-identity migration, after sanchezcloud-identity migration, and
after Scholens migration. The sanchezcloud-identity repository independently migrates
`auth.*`; the Scholens migration container checks the auth ledger and applies
only `scholens.*` with `scholens db upgrade --yes`. Daily API startup remains
Gunicorn-owned and never applies migrations. Both runners use PostgreSQL
advisory locks. The image sets an explicit `SCHOLENS_SERVER_ROOT=/app`
contract, so the CLI
loads the copied `/app/alembic.ini` and `/app/migrations` bundle even though the
Python package itself is installed under `.venv/site-packages`.

The `/admin` login uses an ordinary verified sanchezcloud-identity account and then checks
`scholens.user_profiles.is_admin`. Bootstrap the first administrator out of band
after that account registers:

```bash
scholens users bootstrap-admin --email operator@example.com
```

The command is available only while no usable administrator exists and records
CLI provenance. Subsequent administrator, block, Researcher-grant, and quota
changes must use the audited `scholens users ...` and
`scholens entitlements ...` application commands with `--actor-email`,
`--reason`, and confirmation. `/admin` business views are read-only.

`SCHOLENS_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` only signs the admin browser session; it is not
an administrator password.

Scholens and Scholight may use the same Aliyun DirectMail account credentials.
Keep `SCHOLENS_ALIYUN_DM_FROM_ALIAS` and the Scholens public URL
product-specific so verification and password-reset links return to the correct
frontend. The two products also keep independent JWT secrets and refresh-token
audiences even though both authenticate against `auth.users`.

## One-time host setup

The host needs Docker Engine, Compose v2, AWS CLI, `curl`, `flock`, and SSM connectivity. Its EC2
instance role needs ECR pull, SSM managed-instance, and least-privilege access to the Scholens S3
bucket.

```bash
sudo install -d -m 0755 /opt/scholens /etc/scholens /var/lib/scholens
docker network inspect sanchezcloud-edge >/dev/null 2>&1 || \
  docker network create sanchezcloud-edge
sudo install -m 0644 deploy/production/compose.yaml /opt/scholens/compose.yaml
sudo install -m 0600 deploy/production/bootstrap-db.sql /opt/scholens/bootstrap-db.sql
sudo install -m 0755 deploy/production/release.sh /opt/scholens/release.sh
sudo install -m 0755 deploy/production/smoke.sh /opt/scholens/smoke.sh
sudo install -m 0755 deploy/production/wait-ssm.sh /opt/scholens/wait-ssm.sh
sudo install -m 0755 deploy/production/install-observability.sh /opt/scholens/install-observability.sh
sudo install -m 0755 deploy/production/upload-source-maps.sh /opt/scholens/upload-source-maps.sh
sudo install -m 0644 deploy/production/observability.yaml /opt/scholens/observability.yaml
sudo install -m 0600 deploy/production/runtime.env.example /etc/scholens/runtime.env
sudoedit /etc/scholens/runtime.env
```

Copy the AWS RDS global CA bundle already used by Scholight to
`/etc/scholens/global-bundle.pem`, owned by root and readable by Docker. Install the accompanying
Caddy configuration through the Scholight deployment package; it is the component that owns
ports 80/443 and TLS certificates.

Do not store static AWS access keys in `runtime.env`. The server and jobs images let the AWS SDK
use the EC2 instance role.

Deploy CloudWatch, X-Ray, RUM, alarms, KMS/S3 diagnostic storage, and the host
agent by following [the observability runbook](../../docs/operations/AWS_OBSERVABILITY_SETUP.md).

## AWS and GitHub setup

Create three immutable, scan-on-push ECR repositories:

- `scholens/api`
- `scholens/client`
- `scholens/jobs`

Configure GitHub OIDC roles instead of access keys. Repository/environment variables used by the
release workflow are:

- `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_PUBLISH_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`
- `ECR_API_REPOSITORY`, `ECR_CLIENT_REPOSITORY`, `ECR_JOBS_REPOSITORY`
- `PRODUCTION_PLATFORM` (`linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64`)
- `PRODUCTION_INSTANCE_ID`
- public build values `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`, and the optional future
  canonical Web override `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCOUNT_CENTER_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RUM_APPLICATION_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_RUM_GUEST_ROLE_ARN`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_RUM_IDENTITY_POOL_ID`, and `RUM_SOURCE_MAP_BUCKET` from the
  observability stack outputs

Add `CLOUD_AUTH_READ_TOKEN` as a read-only repository secret. Protect the GitHub `production`
environment with required reviewers. The publish role may push only to the three ECR repositories;
the deploy role may send and inspect SSM commands only for the production instance.

Configure `SCHOLENS_INTEGRATION_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and
`SCHOLENS_SCHOLIGHT_MCP_DELEGATION_JWT_SECRET` in
`/etc/scholens/runtime.env`. The encryption key is URL-safe base64 for exactly
32 random bytes. The delegation secret must match Scholight's
`SCHOLIGHT_MCP_DELEGATION_JWT_SECRET`; Scholens signs a short-lived,
user-scoped token for
each MCP call. External provider API keys are connected per user in Settings
and are never process environment variables.

## Deploy and rollback

Use the `Release` GitHub workflow. `publish` builds digest-addressed images, `deploy` additionally
activates them through SSM, and `rollback` restores the previous coordinated image set.

The host command used by the workflow is:

```bash
sudo /opt/scholens/release.sh deploy \
  --contract-version 1 \
  --package-sha "$PACKAGE_SHA" \
  --release-sha "$GIT_SHA" \
  --api-image "$API_IMAGE" \
  --client-image "$CLIENT_IMAGE" \
  --jobs-image "$JOBS_IMAGE"
```

The release transaction validates the reviewed package checksum and runtime-file permissions,
pulls all images before mutation, runs migrations, activates the coordinated set, and performs
internal API/client/jobs/worker checks plus an external HTTPS check. A failed candidate restores
the previous image set and saves logs under `/var/lib/scholens/failed/<git-sha>/`.

```bash
sudo /opt/scholens/release.sh rollback
sudo /opt/scholens/release.sh status
```

An interrupted activation leaves `/var/lib/scholens/transition.env` and blocks subsequent
operations. Compare the running image digests with `current.env`, restore either the current or
target manifest deliberately, run `smoke.sh`, and only then remove the transition journal.
